The topic I chose was the effect of cloud service on global warming. I’d like to inform people how data centers can be energy-consuming and contribute to CO2 emission. The action I want people to take is to sign a petition, research on the energy consumption level of their future workplaces if they plan to work in the IT industry.  

# Outline of the project
Introduction of Global warming  

Factors contributing to Global warming  

Growing IT industry & data center over the country  

Energy consumption & Co2 emission of data center  

How can enterprises combat it?  

How can individual help - call to action

# Method and Medium
I will use Shorthand to make my final project deliverable, where the reader can find all the charts and texts about the Carbon footprint and energy consumption of data centers.   
For the final presentation, I intend to make a one-pager with Infogram, highlighting the most important data and conclusions, as well as the call to action.
