# About me
Hi there! I'm a first-year Arts Management student at Heinz College, CMU. My pronouns are she/her/hers. I came to CMU right after graduating from the University of Delaware, where I got a BS of Finance and minored in Art. I'm interested in visual art and intend to pursue a career in Non-profit art sector in the future.
# What I hope to learn
Non-profit organizations are increasingly valuing data-analysis, which helps them with audience engagement and analysis. As one way to convey data, data visualization serves an important role in the process.  Though I dealt with numbers in my undergraduate, I didn't have too many chances to learn about graphics and data visualization. I hope to learn more about the ways to effectively communicate results to my audience.   
Additionally, learning about building personal websites at Github is also interesting.
