This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data class at CMU.
# About me
Hi there! I'm a first-year Arts Management student at Heinz College, CMU. My pronouns are she/her/hers. I came to CMU right after graduating from the University of Delaware, where I got a BS of Finance and minored in Art. I'm interested in visual art and intend to pursue a career in Non-profit art sector in the future.
# What I hope to learn
Non-profit organizations are increasingly valuing data-analysis, which helps them with audience engagement and analysis. As one way to convey data, data visualization serves an important role in the process.  Though I dealt with numbers in my undergraduate, I didn't have too many chances to learn about graphics and data visualization. I hope to learn more about the ways to effectively communicate results to my audience.   
Additionally, learning about building personal websites at Github is also interesting.

Here is where all my data visualizations will go.
