This section is an updated version for my project part I, which I made when I was finishing [Part II](/final_projectII_Luna.md) since I changed my topic.  
The topic I chose was the effect of cats on biodiversity. I want to inform people how outdoor cats can predate and kill wildlife and contribute to biodiversity loss. The action I want people to take is to volunteer at/donate to the local animal shelter and to keep their cats indoors.    
# Outline of the Project  
Introduction to Cats Population  
Cat's' Predation Behavior  
Cats' threats to Biodiversity

# The Data Sources
Here are sources of data that Iâ€™m going to use. I might add more/remove some of them when I start working on the project.

# Method and Medium  
I will utilize Tableau, Rawgraph, and other tools we covered in class to recreate data visualization.  
I plan to use Shorthand to make my final project deliverable, where the reader can find all the charts and texts about cats and their effects.
For the final presentation, I intend to make a simple version of my final deliverable, highlighting the most important data and conclusions, as well as the call to action with nav menue on Shorthand.
