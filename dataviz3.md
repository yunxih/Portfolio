# Original Data Visualization
The original data visualization is accessed from http://s28475.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CT17_Supporting_Data.pdf
It is initiated by LaPlaca Cohen to address challenges facing by the cultural industry. This bar chart is one of the support data provided by them.

As shown in the chart, it describes the number of cultural activities participated in per month sorted by race/ethnicity. It is informative, but I believe it would be better to change the color scheme, the bar order, and even change the graph type.
# Wireframe my solution
I chose the pie chart because only percentages are provided in the original data visualization. The sample size of each race/ethnicity is different, so the percentages might not be comparable. A pie chart can work more appropriately with the data.

I sketched a series of pie charts based on race and showed them to my friends. I got some feedback: 1) It's better to show both percentages and population number.  2) The results in each pie seem similar, what's the meaning of making 5 charts? 3) What does the number (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) stand for? Make labels clearer.
However, the population number is unavailable in the document, so I can't include that information. I then showed my friends the original form, and they agreed that the pie charts work better. Therefore, I decide to stick to the pie charts and generated one with Rawgraph.

I realized the color might be too bright, and the texts are hard to read. I showed this one to my friends again and got similar thoughts.
# Final Data Visualization

I added the title, labels, and make the text easier to read. The color scheme is also adjusted to be darker.
I understand that this one cannot substitute the one in the document in that the color scheme is inconsistent with the overall layout, and the size cannot fit. But I believe this one is easier to read and makes more sense compared to the original data visualization.
