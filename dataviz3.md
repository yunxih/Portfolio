# Original Data Visualization
The original data visualization is accessed from http://s28475.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CT17_Supporting_Data.pdf
It is initiated by LaPlaca Cohen to address challenges facing by the cultural industry. This bar chart is one of the support data provided by them.

As shown in the chart, it describes the number of cultural activities participated in per month sorted by race/ethnicity. It is informative, but I believe it would be better to change the color scheme, the bar order, and even change the graph type.
# Wireframe my solution
I chose the pie chart because only percentages are provided in the original data visualization. The sample size of each race/ethnicity is different, so the percentages might not be comparable. A pie chart can work more appropriately with the data.

I sketched a series of pie charts based on race and showed them to my friends. I got some feedback: 1) It's better to show both percentages and population number.  2) The results in each pie seem similar, what's the meaning of making 5 charts? 3) What does the number (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) stand for? Make labels clearer.
