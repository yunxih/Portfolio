This is the part 2 of the final project. I decided to switch my topic since I found this one more interesting to talk about. I will revise part one of the project later as well.
# Wirefames / storyboard for user feedback

# Creation of a user research protocol and completion of at least three interviews

# Revised wireframes / visualizations / storyboards based on what you heard
